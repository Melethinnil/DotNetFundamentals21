You're an administrator for an upcoming event, responsible for managing information about reservations

You need to take information from incoming messages from attendees, which come automatically, and then input that information into the system
	this information is sometimes incorrect or incomplete, and you then need to contact the attendee and get the correct information
		sometimes however, information may appear to be incorrect (such as an alternative spelling of a name), but it in fact is correct

information gained from attendees can be written in different ways, such as them sometimes giving their age and sometimes their birth date

Attendees sometimes also contact you and want to change something or remove their reservation, which you need to do

You need to add whether each attendee has any allergies or not
	They don't always give this information in the first message

If you keep an attendee waiting for too long, they'll get increasingly dissatisfied

the event has an age limit, which means you need to reject reservations from underage attendees
	though be careful that they didn't just accidentally give the wrong age

At the end, you want to have as many attendees as possible, without going over the maximum limit for the event, and have as high a general customer satisfaction as possible
	you'll get negative points for any missing or incorrect information you missed
	you'll get negative points for underage attendees in the system, and also for rejected attendees that weren't actually underage
	(maybe) you also get negative points for reservations that were supposed to be removed but are still in the system
	your point total is finally adjusted based on the overall customer satisfaction percentage

Everything you do is through writing input commands, which need to be very exact (this is the difficulty element)

At first, messages come in relatively slowly and aren't quite as error-prone, but the frequency and error chance increase over time

You also need to generate a unique discount code for each attendee
	attendees who haven't received discount codes reduce the overall customer satisfaction
